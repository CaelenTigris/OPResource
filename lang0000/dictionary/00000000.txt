  |def_prismocitae_desc=$Machine industry makes good use of prismocitae's superefficient regenerating attribute by making hybrid tissues and bionic instruments.
  |def_titanium_desc=$Titanium can be extracted from titan ore. Pure titanium - ready for factorial work - is the most prevalent commodity in Nian machine industry.
  |def_plasteosine_desc=$The starch in HDT is able to blend with titanium on high temperature. The outcome is plasteosine\2C a strong plastic\2C component of many additional electronic devices.
  |def_isopropentol_desc=$During the refinement of HDT - with the addition of other materials - the highly flammable isopropentol can be made. Efficient energy source\3A its heat of combustion exceeds common benzine.
  |def_vitricyl_desc=$Vitricyl is a much lighter and stronger plastic than plasteosine.
  |def_metachropin_desc=$This faceted crystal with useful optical attributes is extracted from the raw stermonit ore. The purified metachropin is mainly used for optical instruments and high-powered lasers.
  |def_prilumium_desc=$This rare\2C crystal structured material is used for manufacturing optical instruments and lasers. The creation of prilumium requires the Nian crude oil - HDT\2C Prismocitae and Stermonit.
  |def_statichnol_desc=$You can gain this considerably useful commodity from the imentium rock. Statichnol is a fluid with high viscosity\2C but it gets more solid than titan under electromagnetic impact.
  |def_phlobotil_desc=$Phlobotil is used especially for military purposes. After a long\2C complicated refinement process\2C this safely containable explosive can be made from the combination of Silgium\2C Liquizit and Triandlus.
  |def_chollonin_desc=$This commodity can be extracted from imentium\2C which is contaminated with useless excretas. It is used similarly to titanium\2C to produce robotic chassis\2C but the crystal structure makes chollonin much more stable.
  |def_alligior_desc=$By combining titan ore\2C HDT and epriton\2C the extremely strong and resistant alligior can be made. This alloy provides the massiveness\2C that larger robot categories require.
  |def_polynucleit_desc=$Liquid polynucleit is needed for the manufacturing of large robots. This efficient catalyst and energy source can be synthesized from Stermonit\2C Liquizit and Prismocitae.
  |def_hydrobenol_desc=$Hydrobenol is the only substance that can start the cold fusion. Extremely useful but highly unstable energy source at the same time.
  |def_espitium_desc=$Espitium is the firmest solid superconductor known - more advanced than Cryoperine. Since it doesn't have any electrical resistance\2C it remains a first-rate material for robotic components.

  |eu_si_maj_ind_desc=$In the early stages of the invasion\2C self-appointed diggers had ruined mining equipment worth millions of NIC so far\2C so the ICS has started this brand new engineer training to filter out private amateurs.
  |eu_si_maj_war_desc=$All the achieved technological advantage of ICS lies in the hands of these engineer whizzes. Only exceptional talents are accepted\2C who carry on the institution’s good reputation.
  |eu_ss_maj_war_desc=$There are times when the job of an undercover Agent is more important than a gunslinger’s. The fact that corporations spend 15-20% of their budget on hunting down enemy spies also shows their importance.
  |eu_ss_maj_ind_desc=$Maintenance of the public communication system is only a minor part of such an expertise. Operating the fluent communication between troops in a warzone is a much more complicated task.
  |asia_sw_maj_war_desc=$Asintec doesn't have an official army\2C so the members of the Asintec's armed forces are mysterious Agents\2C who usually act behind the scenes. Still\2C warfare technology experts are a match for any opposing forces\2C no matter whose army is it.
  |asia_sw_maj_ind_desc=$Since the basic military doctrine of Asintec is territorial integrity\2C the job of defensive tool manufacturers is vital to the security of the megacorporation. These engineers happen to be talented warriors as well.
  |asia_sw_maj_soc_desc=$The early stage of the Nian invasion was fast and efficient\2C mainly because of the coordination experts’ experience. Their job didn’t get any more dispensable\3A they are needed in more and more sectors of the military.
  |asia_si_maj_war_desc=$Military is the most profitable industrial sector\2C thus constant supply of professionals is essential. Combat maneuvers now involve high-tech tools as well\2C therefore adept Agents are highly evaluated.
  |asia_si_maj_ind_desc=$The process of Nian industry is far from the regular monotonity of Earth. Anyone who seeks production opportunities in an extremely dangerous warzone\2C don't hesitate to join!
  |asia_si_maj_soc_desc=$Without proper supervision\2C huge masses of swashbucklers would eventually turn the Syndicate’s carefully built up economic system into a chaos. These coordinators are the bastions in the fortress of authority.
  |asia_ss_maj_war_desc=$Security technicians are Agents\2C who work on the boundaries of the public and undercover sphere. They are the absolute professionals of data\2C property\2C and exalted personage protection. The common respect towards them is often based on fear.
  |asia_ss_maj_ind_desc=$Asintec is proud of the excellent quality of its products\2C and is determined to fulfill market demands with goods of excellent quality. Agents of industrial supervision are famous representatives of the ruthless bureaucracy.
  |asia_ss_maj_soc_desc=$Overproduction of equipment remains pointless until the mass of products are sold. The responsibility is huge\3A analysts are often entrusted to handle fortunes\2C and no mistake is allowed. The majority of the financial sector’s current bosses of Asintec had started their career here.

Time is of the essence\2C don’t make them wait any further.
  |missiontemplate_random_geoscanning_02_desc=$Mineral fields are exploited pretty fast these days\2C but it seems that the planet’s natural underground processes constantly turn up new ones from the deeper layers of the crust.

  |missiontype_tm_ww_level03_exp2_003_desc=$You seem to have stumbled into something way above your pay grade\2C Agent\2C but you’re the Agent on the scene and the one we can spare for the job now. That missile silo you spotted has enough ordnance stored to obliterate most of Hershfield. Frankly\2C we don’t have the means to disable it ourselves\2C but we think we may be able to use some of the Nian attacks on our own facilities as a guide.\0D\0A\0D\0AWe need you to travel to Tellesis to a Nuimqol refinery there. ICS has been having problems with some Nuimqol rebels hacking their valve control points and doing a lot of damage to the equipment as a result. Go to the Refinery\2C find out exactly how the attacks are being carried out\2C and bring that knowledge back with you.
  |missiontype_tm_ww_level03_exp2_004_desc=$Well Agent\2C your Spark now has the information required to sabotage both the missile silo and the radar installation that would guide the missiles to their target. Now all you have to do is stroll on in there and finish the job. Easy\2C right?\0D\0A\0D\0AOr perhaps not. While you were gone we were able to scout the facility and sensors confirm the presence of an unusual Nian Pelistal. It likely represents some type of major leadership figure\2C and as such is probably very well armed and equipped. Unfortunately\2C he is also by far the best candidate to carry the access codes you’ll need to begin hacking the terminal. Go to the facility\2C find the Pelistal leader\2C use his ID codes to get the access codes you need\2C and trash the radar installation and missile silo both. Success on this mission is imperative - if that missile launcher becomes operational\2C it could wipe out Hershfield Terminal altogether.\0D\0A\0D\0AGood luck.
  |missiontype_ics_ii_level03_exp2_001_desc=$Salutations\2C Agent. Since our acquisition of Tellesis\2C we have been spending a considerable amount of time restarting Nuimqol industry and tuning it to our particular needs. There is one particular refinery to the west\2C however\2C that is proving somewhat troublesome. Currently\2C it’s offline\2C and we’d like you to go and figure out what’s gone wrong this time and see about correcting it.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5Bb\5DNote\3A This is a special assignment chain and it may require you to do artifact scans in the future. Equipping a geoscanner is highly advised.\5B/b\5D
  |missiontype_ics_ii_level03_exp2_002_desc=$Glad to see you survived long enough to read this message\2C Agent. Clearly\2C the Nuimqol don’t want this facility up and running\2C so we need to cut down on the number of access points they can meddle with. It might be more inconvenient for the refinery staff\2C but that’s not our problem.
  |missiontype_ics_ii_level03_exp2_003_desc=$Agent\2C the fluid tanks this refinery uses actually come from Thelodica manufacturing facilities\2C but that’s actually an advantage in this case. Asintec has been developing a technology to track anything produced at Thelodica manufacturing centers\2C and they can help us to find our missing fluid tanks.
  |missiontype_ics_ii_level03_exp2_004_desc=$Agent\2C with Asintec’s tracker\2C you should be able to move to the specific points we’ve provided you\2C run a standard artifact scan\2C and locate the rebels holding the fluid tanks and their key components. Obviously\2C you’ll want to both be prepared for a fight and ready to hold the tanks and their components before you go.
  |missiontype_ics_ii_level03_exp2_005_desc=$Prepare for a rough time on this next assignment\2C Agent. The Nuimqol rebels obviously know that you have the tanks back\2C and won’t have to work hard to guess where you’re going next - but you still need to go there. Return to the refinery and restore the fluid tanks. After\2C you’ll need to open the ventilation doors\2C but each of the four doors has a safety mechanism that will require you to hold the switches open for twenty seconds before it locks. It’s a safe bet that the Nuimqol rebels will be hoping to drive you off before you succeed. Good luck.
  |missiontype_ics_ii_level03_exp2_006_desc=$Great work\2C Agent. Your final task is simple - throw the switch that will activate the refinery by opening the pipeline. You’ll find it marked on your map. It’s reasonable to expect that the Nuimqol will try to mount a last stand against you at this point\2C but we expect the bulk of their resistance is already broken.

  |missiontype_asi_ss_level03_exp2_001_desc=$Hello Agent. This should be a relatively simple job for you - we have an archaeological dig at a site northwest from here. We’d like you to take this inventory scanning tool out there to make it easier on the team to continue their research. Once you get the tool out there\2C it will automatically confirm the presence of all the artifacts with a quick diagnostic\2C and then you should be done for the most part.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5Bb\5DMake sure to bring the item you have to deliver with you!\5B/b\5D\0D\0A\0D\0A\5Bb\5DNote\3A This is a special assignment chain and it may require you to do artifact scans in the future. Equipping a geoscanner is highly advised.\5B/b\5D
  |missiontype_asi_ss_level03_exp2_002_desc=$Agent\2C as near as we can tell\2C the missing item seems to be some kind of data disk. Originally\2C we didn’t place much emphasis on decoding it - there’s a lot of information in this dig site - but it’s strange that this one particular item should be missing when a lot of other items we’d expect to see stolen first are still here. I think we need that disk back\2C and since you’re already in the area...
  |missiontype_asi_ss_level03_exp2_003_desc=$Agent\2C we could probably spend a month trying to crack the information on this disk. At the end of that month\2C we might know a quarter of what’s on there. Or we could take a slightly more creative approach\2C and try to pull out the information needed to decode it from a high-ranking Nian. As it so happens\2C our friends over at Truhold-Markson have recently discovered an unusually high-ranking Nian at a Pelistal Base they’re contending with. We don’t much care about the base - what we do care about is you getting the Nian’s data transmission codes. Hop to it\2C Agent.
  |missiontype_asi_ss_level03_exp2_004_desc=$It would seem that a short walk away from our dig site where all this started is another Nian facility\2C and this one may have some very unusual finds\2C if this data disk is to be believed. One thing’s for certain\2C though - the Nians know we have the disk\2C and they know we have the codes to understand the contents. Given how badly they wanted to get this disk away from us\2C whatever is at that other Nian facility must be very dear to them.\0D\0A\0D\0A...which of course means you need to go get it\2C and also means the Nians will probably be trying very hard to stop you. We don’t expect any delays\2C Agent - so you need to get going.

The fastest way is by being active\3A destroying enemy robots\2C completing assignments\2C mining and harvesting\2C or taking part in manufacturing all provide various amounts of EP.\0D\0A\0D\0A2. You also receive a daily package of EP as long as you keep logging in at least every 3 days.\0D\0A\0D\0AYou can also purchase an '''EP booster''' which increases both the daily package and the EP coming from activities. Also\2C while the booster is active\2C you don't have to worry if you miss to log in for more than 3 days.\0D\0A\0D\0AIf you acquire enough EP for an extension\2C you can instantly install or upgrade it.

You’ll also get an entry in your '''active assignments''' list\2C so you can keep track if you have multiple assignments ongoing.\0D\0A\0D\0AMake sure that the '''Sequer''' is still your active robot\2C and let’s deploy to the terrain.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_assignments_trigger04_desc=$There is also a window available here on the terrain which helps you track your assignments and their objectives.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_assignments_trigger05_desc=$You can keep track of the '''status of your objectives''' here on the terrain in this window\3A red means incomplete\2C green means complete. The letter icons of the objectives are also shown on the terrain and in the landmarks list just like any other object\2C so you can use them as navigation reference.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_assignmentpickup.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0ANote that the objective icons are just location indicators. You can’t interact with them\2C you need to interact with the objects that are near them.\0D\0A\0D\0ASo this assignment is a quick '''pickup and delivery''' task\2C just to have a little taste of how things go - follow the objectives and complete the assignment. If the objectives are too vague for you\2C just bring up the assignment information window with the '''“info” button''' and the detailed description should help you out.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_assignments_trigger06_desc=$Nice work! For your next task you’ll need another robot so just enter the terminal to finish this one.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger01_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_argano.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AAlthough the Syndicate provides some basic equipment ready to use\2C most of the robots and modules need to be '''produced''' by our Agents\2C with the help of various industrial facilities in the terminals. The most basic resources for industrial production are '''raw minerals''' - this is where mining comes in.\0D\0A\0D\0AWe have sent an '''Argano''' into your private storage. It’s a light industrial robot specialized for mining\2C but we’re also going to use it now for some harvesting and artifact hunting.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger02_desc=$The robot is already equipped with everything we’ll need\2C so just deploy to the terrain.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger03_desc=$You’ll need to use the Terminal teleport again\2C but this time choose the '''Industrial area''' destination.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger04_desc=$Since the '''mineral fields''' are under the surface we need to use '''geoscanners''' to locate them. Geoscanner modules are pretty versatile\3A depending on the charge you load into them\2C they can be used for different scanning methods.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_geoscannerammo.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AThe first step now is to find the general location of a mineral field by using a method called '''directional scanning'''. Changing between different types of charges works almost like reloading a module\3A just right click the geoscanner module\2C open up the '''“Ammo/charge”''' submenu\2C and select the directional geoscanner charge.\0D\0A\0D\0ANote that there are specific geoscanner and miner charges for each type of mineral and you need to load the correct one\2C like in this case for Solibdit.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger05_desc=$Wait until the module finishes loading and then activate it.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger06_desc=$The directional scan does what its name suggests\3A it points you the direction towards the '''nearest mineral field''' of the scanned type\2C represented by the '''red arrow'''. The arrow doesn’t measure distance however\2C it only points towards the direction of the minerals\2C not the exact location.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_directionalscan.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AThe method to follow here is to go towards the direction of the arrow\2C do another scan\2C adjust your bearing towards the new arrow\2C and so on. Once you get close enough to the minerals\2C a '''red X''' will be shown instead of an arrow.\0D\0A\0D\0A''Tip\3A a smart scanning method is to do a scan\2C move sideways away from the arrow\2C and do another scan. The imaginary point where the two arrows would cross should be very close to your goal.''
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger07_desc=$Nice. Now that we have the general location of the Solibdit field\2C it’s time to pull out some precision tools. '''Tile-based geoscanner charges''' work only with a relatively small coverage\2C but they show exactly which ground tiles have minerals and also how much of it.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger08_desc=$Again\2C wait until loading is finished and activate your scanner.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger09_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_tilescan.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AThe result of the scan is projected onto the terrain like a '''heat map'''. Blue-green means low\2C yellow is pretty good\2C and red means the largest amount of minerals.\0D\0A\0D\0ANote that your geoscanner module has an '''accuracy''' parameter. If this value is lower than 100%\2C the geoscan result will be more or less noisy\2C which makes it harder to spot tiles with low amounts of minerals. You can check your geoscanner’s accuracy by doing a rightclick-info on it.\0D\0A\0D\0A''Tip\3A accuracy can be increased by using higher tier equipment or upgrading the relevant extensions.''\0D\0A\0D\0ABefore you can start mining\2C you need to select a ground tile that has some minerals and '''lock it''' as a target. Go for a yellow or red tile if possible.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger10_desc=$Your miner module should be already loaded with Solibdit miner charges\2C so just simply activate it to start mining the locked ground tile.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_scanningmining_trigger11_desc=$If you open up your cargo window now\2C you can see that it’s slowly being filled up with Solibdit.\0D\0A\0D\0AWe don’t need much of it though\2C so just '''deactivate''' your miner module and '''move on to the next task.'''
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_harvesting_trigger01_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_harvest.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0ARaw materials can also be gathered from certain wild growing '''plants'''. If a ground tile has a plant on it\2C the landmark information panel will show that. The plants that can be harvested will show the amount they hold with a yellow number.\0D\0A\0D\0AContrary to mining\2C harvesting doesn’t need different charges for different plants - one charge fits all. There is also no scanning involved here\2C you just simply need to '''use your eyes''' to find some.\0D\0A\0D\0AThe plant we’re looking for now is one with purple-pink round growths called '''Helioptris'''.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_harvesting_trigger02_desc=$Activate your harvester module and it will start the gathering process.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_harvesting_trigger03_desc=$A few cycles is enough just to see how it works. Deactivate it and '''move on to the next task'''.
  |tutorialchecklist_advanced_artifacts_trigger01_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Aartifact_scanner.png\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AAnother very handy feature of a geoscanner is that it can search for long-lost (or purposefully buried\2C who knows...) artifacts.\0D\0A\0D\0AArtifacts can contain scraps\2C ammo\2C industrial stuff\2C minerals\2C and even rare high-tech equipment. Beware that some of the artifacts are guarded and enemy robots will appear when you find them.\0D\0A\0D\0AThere are 3 kinds of '''artifact scanner charges'''\2C with different scanning ranges\3A 1000\2C 3000\2C and 5000 meters. The higher the range\2C the more expensive the charge\2C so the strategy here is to start with high range and change to a lower one as soon as you get close enough of an '''artifact signal'''.\0D\0A\0D\0AFor this test we’ll be using the middle one\2C the R-30 charge.

  |tutorialchecklist_complex_refining_trigger01_desc=$Raw materials that you mine or harvest need to be refined in order to be used in production.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_refining_trigger02_desc=$You can select which refined commodity you want to create from the '''dropdown menu'''. Type the amount you want to create\2C and the required amount of raw materials will be displayed on the left.\0D\0A\0D\0ASome raw minerals\2C like titan ore\2C can be directly refined into a commodity. However\2C most of the commodities need to be created with a combination of two or more materials.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_refine.jpg\7Ccenter\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0ARefining happens instantly\2C you just have to click the '''create button'''. We have sent a stack of titan ore into your private storage\2C go ahead and refine some.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_recycling_trigger01_desc=$Commodities can also be created by recycling equipment that you don't need.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_recycling_trigger02_desc=$If you open the '''Recycling plant'''\2C it will list all the equipment in your storage that can be recycled. Select the items you want to recycle using the '''checkboxes'''\2C and the amounts you would get by recycling them will be shown on the right. Like refining\2C recycling also happens instantly.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_recycle.jpg\7Ccenter\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0A''Tip\3A you can also directly select items to recycle if you right-click them in your storage and select "Recycle". (Works on multiple selected items too.)''
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_research_trigger01_desc=$Now you know how to acquire the materials to build something\2C but you also need the knowledge. This happens by researching the appropriate '''technology'''.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_research_trigger02_desc=$All the technology that you can research is organized into a number of '''technology trees'''. Research needs to start from a '''root item'''\2C and from there you can work your way towards more advanced items to the right.\0D\0A\0D\0AThe research process looks like this\3A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_kernel.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0A* Researching an item requires '''Research Points (RP)'''.\0D\0A* RP can be acquired by researching '''kernels'''. They are dropped as loot by enemy robots\2C and they can also be found in some artifacts.\0D\0A* Different technologies require different types of RP\2C which are mostly tied to a faction. For example looting Pelistal (green) robots will give you Pelistal kernels\2C and researching them will yield Pelistal RP. Your available RP of each type is shown on the top.\0D\0A\0D\0AWe have sent a couple of '''Common kernels''' into your private storage. These kernels are dropped by all the factions. Research them to get some common RP.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_research_trigger03_desc=$One kernel equals 1 RP of the appropriate type\2C simple as that. Now that you have some RP\2C let's find some tech that you can unlock.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_research_trigger04_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_research.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AYou should have enough common RP to unlock the Standard light autocannon that's located in the first column on the Common I page. (You might have to scroll down a bit to see it.)
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_research_trigger05_desc=$Researching an item enables you to unlock the items connected to it\2C if you have enough RP of course. Move on to the next task to see what you can do with this newly acquired knowledge.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_prototyping_trigger01_desc=$So now that you have the technology\2C you can create a prototype. Prototyping is very '''expensive'''\2C but you only need one to create many copies of it via mass production.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_prototyping_trigger02_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_prototype.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AOn the left you'll see all your known technology that you have unlocked via research. Select the '''Standard light autocannon''' and on the right you'll see what commodities you need to build it. We have sent a good bunch of Titanium and Axicoline to your storage so you don't have to worry about that now.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_reverseengineering_trigger01_desc=$Reverse engineering is used to create '''Calibration Templates (CTs)''' by studying prototypes. CTs are basically "recipes" for mass production\2C we use them to calibrate our factory production lines to manufacture a specific item.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_prototyping_trigger03_desc=$The process will '''take some time'''\2C depending on your extensions\2C the facility itself\2C and the type of the item. In the interest of time\2C industrial processes are vastly sped up during this virtual training.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_reverseengineering_trigger02_desc=$In order to reverse engineer something\2C you need an item (usually a prototype) and a '''decoder''' of the required level. Like kernels\2C decoders can be acquired from enemy loot or artifacts. Both the item and the decoder are '''consumed''' during the process.\0D\0A\0D\0AThe prototyping of your standard autocannon should be finished by now\2C so drag it into the reverse engineering window. We have sent an extra autocannon to your storage too\2C just in case.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_reverseengineering_trigger03_desc=$We've also sent you a decoder\2C drag that one in too.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_reverseengineering_trigger04_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_reverseengineer.jpg\7Ccenter\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0ABefore you start the process you can check the quality of the resulting CT. Higher '''material efficiency''' means that you will need less materials to mass produce this item\2C and a higher '''time efficiency''' means that it will take less time.\0D\0A\0D\0A''Tip\3A if you have a higher level decoder than what's required\2C you can use it instead to achieve a higher quality CT and reduce the time and cost of the reverse engineering process.''
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_reverseengineering_trigger05_desc=$''Note\3A normally you don't need to create prototypes of "standard" items\2C because they can be used directly in reverse engineering. Only higher tier equipment and robots need to be prototyped.''
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_massproduction_trigger01_desc=$The factory is the final stage of the production chain\2C this is where mass production happens.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_massproduction_trigger02_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_ct.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AYou have a number of '''production lines''' available here\2C which can be '''calibrated''' to produce items by applying CTs to them. '''Wait''' until the reverse engineering process that you have started is finished (if it's still running)\2C and then drag the created CT into the factory.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_massproduction_trigger03_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_factory.jpg\7Ccenter\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0ASelect the calibrated production line and you'll see the required materials to manufacture it\2C just like in the prototype facility. Since this is mass production\2C you will usually do more than one '''manufacturing cycle'''\2C so you can input that here as well\2C and the required material amounts will be automatically updated. For now though\2C one autocannon will be enough.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_massproduction_trigger04_desc=$Note that every production cycle will '''degrade''' the calibration and decrease its efficiency. A line with low efficiency will require increasingly '''more materials''' and will take more time to produce something\2C so eventually the point will come where it's not worth to use it anymore. When this happens\2C you can delete the calibration from the line's right-click menu and apply a new CT created in reverse engineering.\0D\0A\0D\0AThis is all you need to know about the industry for now. '''Move on to the next task''' and we'll do some shooting again\2C this time with something bigger.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_thelodicarobots_trigger01_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_artemis.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0ATo be fair\2C this will be a bit teasing. The '''mech-class''' robots you’re about to try won’t be available to you from the start\2C you will have to work for them. But it’s important that you get a good impression about the different factions\2C so you can make a choice without regrets.\0D\0A\0D\0AThe first one you’re going to test is the '''Artemis'''. It’s a mech of the Thelodica faction\2C who are specialized in '''laser weaponry'''.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_thelodicarobots_trigger02_desc=$It’s equipped with a few interesting modules that we’ll also try out\2C so let’s jump outside.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_thelodicarobots_trigger03_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_artemisbonus.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AAll robots have certain special '''bonuses''' which make them excel in certain fields. You can take a look at these bonuses if you bring up the information window of your robot (the blue i icon on your robot status panel)\2C and click the bonuses tab.\0D\0A\0D\0AThe Artemis receives bonuses to its armor resistance values. The damage output of all weapons is a combination of four possible '''damage types'''\3A kinetic\2C thermal\2C seismic\2C or chemical. Armor resistance will\2C as the name says\2C resist a percentage of the appropriate incoming damage type.\0D\0A\0D\0ASo this mech already has a good base of resists\2C but we can top that in order to receive as little damage as possible. There are two types of modules for this purpose\3A active and passive armors.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_armors.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0A'''Active armors'''\2C like the equipped seismic and thermal armors give large resistance boosts for a specific damage type\2C but they have to be activated and use some energy. The '''universal armor''' (also equipped on your robot) is a passive module\2C you just need to equip it and it does its thing. It provides resistance boosts to all four damage types\2C but only small amounts for each.\0D\0A\0D\0AActivate the seismic armor module\2C and you’ll see that its effect icon will appear under your robot status panel. All active effects that boost or harm your robot in any way will appear here. Hover over them with your mouse to get more information.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_thelodicarobots_trigger04_desc=$The main advantage of lasers is their relatively '''large range'''\2C and that they are more '''precise''' when hitting smaller targets than other weapon types.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_sensoramp.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AHowever\2C a large weapon range is only good if you can lock a target that far. This is when a '''sensor amplifier''' can come in handy\2C which not only boosts your robot’s locking range\2C but also the time it needs to lock targets. It’s an active module as well\2C but only uses a low amount of energy to operate.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_thelodicarobots_trigger05_desc=$''Tip\3A logically\2C it’s always optimal to have a locking range that is larger than your weapons’ range. You can compare these if you check the information panels of your robot and your weapon modules.''\0D\0A\0D\0AAlright that’s enough talk\2C let’s head to the '''shooting range'''.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_thelodicarobots_trigger06_desc=$Note that your active modules are turned off by the teleport\2C so you will need to activate them again to make them work.\0D\0A\0D\0AWell\2C you know the drill\2C primary lock a '''Drone''' and destroy it. The task will complete after one kill already\2C but feel free to stay around and do some more shooting to get a feel for it.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_thelodicarobots_trigger07_desc=$Head back to the terminal when you’re done\2C the '''next mech''' already awaits you.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_pelistalrobots_trigger01_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_tyrannos.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AYou might have noticed that the Artemis didn’t only have lasers\2C but one missile launcher as well. This is the case for all mechs\2C they are using a mixed set of weapons to be versatile.\0D\0A\0D\0AThe next robot actually uses '''missiles''' as primary weapons\2C with guns as secondary armament. This is the '''Tyrannos'''\2C the mech of the ballistics-specialist Pelistal faction.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_pelistalrobots_trigger02_desc=$Missiles are quite different compared to guns\2C because they '''shoot in an arc''' instead of a straight line. This makes it possible to attack something even from behind cover. Let’s deploy and see how this works in practice.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_pelistalrobots_trigger03_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_missiles.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AAnother peculiar trait of missiles is that unlike guns\2C which have short and long range versions\2C the range difference here lies in the loaded ammo. This allows you to be effective at both '''short and long ranges'''\2C you just have to switch to the appropriate missiles. There should be a few of both types in your cargo\2C feel free to change them if you want.\0D\0A\0D\0ALet’s hit the '''shooting range''' again.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_pelistalrobots_trigger04_desc=$The Tyrannos gets a bonus for its accumulator recharge time\2C and we have even boosted this by equipping an '''accumulator recharger''' and an '''auxiliary accumulator''' module. Why do we need so much energy? Because we also have a shield generator module.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_shield.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AWhen your '''shield''' is active\2C it will perfectly deflect enemy fire. To be able to do this however\2C it will use energy from your robot’s accumulator - the more damage\2C the more energy used. So effectively your accumulator becomes your second armor\2C as long as it has energy to consume.\0D\0A\0D\0ALet’s lock a Drone to get its attention\2C but '''don’t shoot it just yet'''.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_pelistalrobots_trigger05_desc=$Now activate your shield generator and watch how the bullets get deflected by it.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_pelistalrobots_trigger06_desc=$Sadly there is always a catch\3A shields deflect shots from both sides\2C so you '''can’t fire''' your weapons while your shield is active. '''Deactivate''' your shield and kill any attacking drones so they won’t bother you anymore.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_shootscarab.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0ASo remember that missiles can shoot over things? There is a bunch of '''Hauler drones''' nearby which are enclosed by a tall fence. Go ahead and try to kill one with your machine guns only - you’ll probably won’t succeed and only hit the walls.\0D\0A\0D\0AThe only way to kill one is by using your missiles from the proper distance. Let’s see if you can do that.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_pelistalrobots_trigger07_desc=$Great\2C you’re getting the hang of this. Kill some more if you like and then return to the terminal again for the '''last mech'''.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_nuimqolrobots_trigger01_desc=$\5B\5BImage\3Achecklist_kain.jpg\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AThe last mech we’ll show you is the Nuimqol faction’s '''Kain'''. This faction specializes in '''magnetic weaponry'''\2C which have a relatively short range\2C but the sheer damage they can deal makes up for it.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_nuimqolrobots_trigger02_desc=$This mech also has a few interesting modules equipped\2C let’s deploy and we’ll have a look at them.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_nuimqolrobots_trigger03_desc=$'''Speed''' is one of the key aspects of combat. If you’re faster than your enemy\2C you can easily catch up to your prey\2C but you also have a higher chance of escaping from a tight situation.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5B\5BImage\3Amass_reductor.png\7Cright\7Cnolink\5D\5D\0D\0AThe Kain is already the fastest of the three mechs\2C but we have even topped that by equipping a '''lightweight frame'''. This module increases your speed by making your robot lighter\2C but it also reduces its armor. Good thing that one of the Kain’s bonuses is boosting armor repair\2C which is further supported by the armor repairer tuning module. The evasive module makes your robot harder to hit\2C and an active armor is added to compensate the Kain’s weakest resistance\2C thermal.\0D\0A\0D\0ALet’s head to the '''shooting range''' once again and see what it can do.
  |tutorialchecklist_complex_nuimqolrobots_trigger04_desc=$There is not much left to say really. Lock on and light up those gauss guns!
  |mission_tutorialchecklist_transport_desc=$This assignment is about the pickup and delivery of a larger package.\0D\0A\0D\0AThere are three objectives\2C marked \5Bcolor\3D\2300d8ff\5D\5Bb\5DA\5B/b\5D\5B/color\5D\2C \5Bcolor\3D\2300d8ff\5D\5Bb\5DB\5B/b\5D\5B/color\5D\2C and \5Bcolor\3D\2300d8ff\5D\5Bb\5DC\5B/b\5D\5B/color\5D\3A\0D\0A\0D\0A\5Bcolor\3D\2300d8ff\5D\5Bb\5DObjective A\5B/b\5D\5B/color\5D is a "reach position" type\2C you simply have to move to the objective point.\0D\0A\0D\0A\5Bcolor\3D\2300d8ff\5D\5Bb\5DObjective B\5B/b\5D\5B/color\5D needs you to activate the \5Bcolor\3D\23ffffff\5D\5Bb\5DItem supply\5B/b\5D\5B/color\5D object by double clicking on it.
